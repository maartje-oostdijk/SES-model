# SD SES model
scripts for running the simple SES model, with mesopelagic population & carbon dynamics, fishery component and governance component, constructed for the EU project MEESO, model made by Maartje Oostdijk in collaboration with Laura Elsler, Julie van Deelen, Willem Auping & Jan Kwakkel

difference_ses_model.py is a python script (open & edit in any text editor, e.g. sublime) 

difference_ses_model_DMDU.ipynb is a jupyter notebook script that interacts with the model to perform multiple runs over designated uncertainties, these code bits require the install of EMA V2.2 (exploratory modeling and analysis) workbench library maintained by Jan Kwakkel and collaborators. More information on EMA installs can be found here: https://github.com/quaquel/EMAworkbench
